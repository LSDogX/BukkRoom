# BukkRoom
___

> ...... This was in my dream ......

- This plugin is aim to recreate backrooms in bukkit server

- After that, maybe I'll going to start a server to run this

## How to use (preview):
___
- Build this plugin, we don't have any dependency yet so just build it... trust me
- Drop it to the plugin folder
- Add following lines in `Bukkit.yml`:
```yaml
worlds:
  world:
    generator: BukkRoom
```
- Delete the existed world if there's a `world` folder
- Let server generate the world
- Cool, now u can see a BukkRoom style's level-0, summon some tnt to break this terrible fake world

___

```
Thinking:
    1. Running on a single server.
    2. Create multiple worlds.
    3. Command "/level 0".
    4. Number 4.
